# Deciphering-The-Digital-Mask-Fake-Face-Detection

Deciphering the Digital Mask: Fake Face Detection is a web-based project uses sophisticated machine learning algorithms to identify fake facial photos. The technology offers consumers an easy-to-use interface for instantaneous image authenticity evaluation. By providing precise detection and instructional materials, it seeks to reduce the dangers connected with digital face modification, improving digital integrity and security in a future where artificial intelligence is becoming more and more prevalent.

# Objective
Our objective is to develop a website that can reliably detect whether an image is fake (manipulated facial images) or real using advanced technologies. The project aims to address the growing threat of digital misinformation and the proliferation of fake content, particularly in the form of altered facial images and deepfakes
